## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To compile and run the C++ exercises, you will need:

- A C++ compiler such as **g++**, **clang**, or **Microsoft Visual Studio**.
- A development environment (optional) such as **Visual Studio Code**, **CLion**, or **Eclipse**.

### Compilation

You can compile any of the C++ files by navigating to the corresponding directory and running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
g++ -o output_name exercise_file.cpp
```

For example:

```bash
g++ -o array_example array/array_example.cpp
./array_example
```
