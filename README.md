# C++ Exercises

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of C++ exercises designed to help improve your programming skills. The exercises cover a wide range of topics, including basic syntax, data structures, algorithms, object-oriented programming (OOP), and more advanced C++ features like templates and memory management.

## Key Features

- **Beginner to Advanced**: Exercises range from beginner-level C++ syntax to advanced features such as templates and memory management.
- **Algorithm Implementation**: Exercises include common algorithms like sorting, searching, and recursion.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Hands-on exercises for OOP concepts, including classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Data Structures**: Implement and manipulate common data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To compile and run the C++ exercises, you will need:

- A C++ compiler such as **g++**, **clang**, or **Microsoft Visual Studio**.
- A development environment (optional) such as **Visual Studio Code**, **CLion**, or **Eclipse**.

### Compilation

You can compile any of the C++ files by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
g++ -o output_name exercise_file.cpp
```

For example:

```bash
g++ -o variables basics/variables.cpp
./variables
```
